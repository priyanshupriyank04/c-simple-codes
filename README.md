# c-simple-codes
This file is being created by the owner...yeah that's me while I go on my journey to learn coding starting with C++ language for now.
I would be adding all the codes I write in my journey be it any sort of dsa question or any other random quiz or code I write.
I would be making separate repositories when I switch to java followed by web dev, looking forward to an enticing coding journey.
